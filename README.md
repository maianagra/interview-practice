# 🧑‍💻 Interview Practice

This repository is a collection of coding practice tasks and experiments I’ve completed to prepare for technical interviews.  
It contains small, focused exercises across different languages and technologies — including **React**, **TypeScript/JavaScript**, and **Python**.  

The goal of this repo is to:
- Practice solving problems under time constraints  
- Build fluency with common frontend and backend patterns  
- Prepare for interview coding tasks with realistic exercises
